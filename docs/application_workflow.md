Application Workflow
====================

The MClassrooms application pulls details for buildings and classrooms that belong to Central Campus. In addition, MClassrooms will pull details for the following buildings:

Moore Earl V Building

Francis Thomas Jr Public Health Building

Vaughan Henry Frieze Public Health Building

400 North Ingalls Building

Stamps Auditorium

Walgreen Chalres R Jr Drama Center

MClassrooms only pulls in rooms with the "Classrooms" Room Type in MPathways. Room details are pulled from MPathways through an Application Programming Interface (API). The API script updates the MClassrooms every day at 3:00AM EST. Certain details about the buildings and rooms updated and saved in MPathways will display in MClassrooms.

If a room is not displayed in MClassrooms but should, check to make sure that the room is classified as "Classrooms" in MPathways first. If it is, then submit a ticket to the development team by clicking on Report an Issue at the bottom of the MClassrooms page.

If a new building or new room detail needs to display in MClassrooms, then submit a ticket to the development team by clicking on Report an Issue at the bottom of the MClassrooms page.
